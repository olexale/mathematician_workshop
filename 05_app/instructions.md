# Real App

## Congratulations, you've made it! ðŸ¥³

No secret knowledge is required to write code as a mathematician. The main idea is to keep the core of the app pure (and so predictable and easily testable) and sprinkle a little bit of real-world beauty on its surface so that the app will become meaningful.

You already know everything you need to know for writing code as a mathematician:
* the difference between pure and impure functions;
* how to refactor a class to a function;
* how to deal with dependencies (currying);
* how to store multiple values in a single variable;

Let's refactor a _real_ app now! In the editor, you may find a console Dart application, that pretends to be a weather app. While the app is tiny it already has some problems with testability. Your task is to find what's wrong and fix it. Do not forget to open the solution and validate your work afterward.

## Next steps ðŸ’ƒ

Writing code as a mathematician is a lot of fun. But it's not all fun if you don't have good data structures and don't know some common patterns to rely on. 

To help you with the first thing there are two awesome packages (you have already seen them twice in this workshop):
* [`fpdart`](https://pub.dev/packages/fpdart)
* [`dartz`](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz)

And here are a bunch of links that might help you with the patterns:
* ["Functional Dart" talk](https://youtu.be/p9dY-vp7xzY)
* [The "Thinking functionally" series](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/thinking-functionally/)
* [Railway Oriented Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/)
* [Dart Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures](https://medium.com/p/ddd8c54bce15)
* [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala-second-edition) - the idea of the Coffee shop sample is from this book
